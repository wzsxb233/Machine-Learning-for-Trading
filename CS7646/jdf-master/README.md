# Joyner Document Format

Welcome to the **2022 update** of the Joyner Document Format official LaTeX class.

## TeX Installation

If you already have Tex installed and configured for your OS than you can likely skip to Quick Start section

### MacOS

```sh
brew install text-live-utility
# Ensure required packages are installed
sudo tlmgr install collection-latexrecommended collection-latexextra collection-fontsrecommended collection-fontsextra collection-mathscience
```

### Linux

```sh
# For Ubuntu (From https://github.com/iamjakewarner/jdf/pull/15/files)
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

### Windows

Could possibly follow the Linux guide on WSL

## CLI Quick start

You can clone this repo and try typesetting `jdf-starter.tex`
with the following commands:

```sh
biber jdf-starter
pdflatex jdf-starter
```

The result should look like `jdf-starter.pdf`.
* `biber` command generates used references from `references.bib` 
* `pdflatex` command generates the final pdf 

## Adding jdf.cls to Global TeX

The `jdf.cls` file can be referenced by updating the `TEXINPUTS` with the path to the git checkout

```sh
export TEXINPUTS=/path/to/the/checkout/jdf/
```

## VSCode Quick Start

1. Add the [Latex Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) Extension
    - Ensure that `texlive` for your OS is installed. See additional instructions in the extensions' README
1. Use the preview icon (top left) or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + V). This will open up a live preview.
1. Once done, use the green play button, or use keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + B) to build the project and generate PDF.
